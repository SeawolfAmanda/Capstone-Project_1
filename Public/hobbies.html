    <h1>What Do I Enjoy?</h1>
    <hr/>
    <h2>Playing DnD</h2>
        <h3>Campaigns</h3>
            <p> I've been apart of 3 different campaigns, 3 different characters, and tons of adventures.</p>
        <h4>My personal history of playing DnD</h4>
            <p>My first character also happens to be my favorite character. 
                Her name is Kalishniam, she's a Fighter Wood Elf, and wears 6in stilleto heels.
            </p>

            <p>Those of you who know a thing or two about DnD are most likely wondering how I managed to convince my DM to not
                only allow my character to have heels, but also avoid having a disadvantage...that is 
                the power of having a strong backstory.
            </p>
            <P>Not only did he allow it, not give me disadvantage, but gave me a Charisma modifier at that.</P>
        <h4>My Current Character</h4>
            <p>"Willard Blundar", a Halfling Rouge with outstanding sneak abilities.</p>
                <img src="../Images/Willard Blundar.png" alt="DnD character sheet" height="100">
            <p>I would not be surprised if one day Willard becomes my favorite character to play at this point...He is extrememly charismatic, sneaky, and has so many connections across the globe.</p>
            <p>I'm lucky enough to have the same DM for Willard that I had for Kalishniam, and he just introduced Kalishniam into our current campaign as an NPC. Needless to say, I'm excited to see where this story goes.</p>

            <h2>Hiking Around</h2>
    <img src="../Images/Hiking.jpg" alt="woods" height="100"/>
            <h3>Where?</h3>
                <p>Living in Wisconsin gives me the opportunity to hike at thousands of state parks, local parks, and even a massive National Forest.</p>
                <p>The dream is to eventually own a small cabin in the Northern Woods surrounded by trees, nature, and paths.</p>
                <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/cnnf">Chequamegon-Nicole National Forest</a>
                <h3>When?</h3>
                    <p>I'll have to admit, I have only hiked during Spring and Summer at this point.  I would love to get into some Autumn and Winter hiking.</p>
                    <p>I can also admit, I don't care for Spring hiking...considering the mess it can make. </p>
            <h3>With Whom?</h3>
                <p>I will go hiking with anyone!</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Friends</li>
                        <li>Family</li>
                        <li>Strangers
                            <ul>
                                <li>Safe Strangers</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Learning New Things</h2>
        <img src="../Images/History.png" alt="history collage" height="100"/>
        <p>It took me a very long time to appreciate the concept of History, and now that I do it's one of my favorite topics.</p>
        <p>I've always been interested in learning new things, in the past that just meant "new" things (for example: Web Development)</p>
        <p>In the last 2 years I've realized that the past is far more intriguing, informative, and necessry than I originally thought. The things we could learn from the past, and grow from is outstanding. I do my best to make sure I keep this in mind at all times, and that
        I pay attention to where I've been, and where I can go.</p>
